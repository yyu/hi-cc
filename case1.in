CHICAGO (Reuters) - Judging by their "before" and "after" photo-
graphs, US presidents appear to age before our eyes, adding wrinkles
 and gray hair with each year in office.

"That would imply that they died sooner than the rest of us," Olshansky
said in a telephone interview.

To estimate the toll serving as US president took, he subtracted 2 days
for every 1 day in office, approximating the effects of aging at twice
the normal rate. At that rate, a four-year term would cut a president's
estimated remaining lifespan by 8 years
